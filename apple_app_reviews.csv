There’s a great FTP test at the beginning. However, I didn’t feel great, quit early and now I can’t retest it. When you’re in a workout, there’s a window that pops up for maybe two seconds to show your targets for that interval. Better be staring at your phone and read quickly, otherwise you’ll have no idea what you targets are. There’s a small chart at the bottom that shows three lines (best guess is power, cadence and speed). It only show next 30 seconds.

They clearly are not focusing on updating the app to fix various bugs, such as the fact that calibration is a massive problem for many of their users. The interface itself is non-intuitive, with confusing messages to use simple functions like calibration, and syncing. When you read support messages around many of the issues, they essentially blame the user. While their early, non-smart versions of their trainer were good, they have simply not kept up with the times. They’ve been playing catch-up for 5+ years. instead of fixing issues or even getting ahead of the curve, they are hanging on for dear life and hoping to keep enough loyal users to keep revenues steady and eventually get bought by a bigger fish.

Providing a menu option of fourscore or more alert tones to choose from for every action would be an excellent addition.  Currently, the default tone is the same as a text notification, but I would like the option to choose a more “attention-grabbing” alert (especially with how sensitive the remotes are-simply having my keys jiggle in my pocket has opened the door without my knowledge while I have been in my office, and I ignored the OHD Anywhere alert as it was the same tone as a text alert-leaving the garage door open until I had a chance to pull the phone out and see it wasn’t a text alert, but the “door open” alert).2.

When people hear the collaborations they’re amazed and often ask how it’s done. When I tell them about the app they either purchase it on the spot, or they complain that it cost money. Seriously? For less than one dinner out, this app allows you to record with people anywhere in the world. Acapella has been a hugely instrumental to me and I would recommend it for so many reasons. Whether you are your own band or Acapella singer and want to record multiple tracks, or you are looking for a way to collaborate with friends, it’s a great platform.

And I will lose people because it won’t be worth the money for them, or they can’t afford it, especially if we don’t know if it’ll work for us yet. This is a developer who is now taking advantage of a situation where volunteer groups are just wanting to make music together during this COVID situation . . . until they can come together again. These aren’t professional musicians, they just want to gather a few moments in voice. Congratulations for ruining a decent thing. I don’t mind paying for fair price/service . . .

If you can afford shelling out $50 a year it’s great! However most students and musicians don’t have money for a looping app they just want to experiment with. You are better off investing your money in sound equipment and a DAW because you’d have those long term to record on rather than be stuck paying a subscription to a phone app...If this was like iReal Pro and only asked for a one time purchase it would be much more worth while. Even if it’s a steep purchase price, you’d have the tool on your phone to mess around with whenever you felt like getting creative. Sad to see reviews of people that paid the previous one time purchase which has apparently been voided since they changed the terms to a monthly subscription as well.... greed in action, making it harder than it has to be for musicians and artists to find their voice.I’d happily give this app 5 stars if the In-app purchases page was truthful at it really was a one time purchase of 7.99 for all the features.",0.2027777777777778

Being able to hear my other recorded parts while I record is what caught my interest. Now that I’ve used the app more, I’ve found out how limited this app is. There isn’t an editor where you can move tracks around or have a part that appears for only part of the song. You have to record each part in one go. This app is also only available on mobile, which I find annoying because my phone’s mic quality isn't what you would call good. I also wanted to make use of the guide music that  would have been really useful to listen to while recording, but for some reason Acapella only uses Apple Music songs that require a subscription which I’m not paying for to play more than 30 seconds of the song I want.

The real huge bummer is the fact that I can’t record over 1 minute without purchasing a regular subscription for roughly $50 a year. The price in itself isn’t a huge issue but the fact that the advanced features are only temporary sort of irks me a bit including not being able to save my files in the free version. I would have no problem paying a one time $50 price tag upfront for a full version of the app but it feels like a slap in the face when they want a yearly paycheck from people who want to use this. The app itself is wonderful. If you like making Instagram videos it’s great because they can only be one minute anyway. I would recommend this app to friends but the subscription is a little too much for the advanced version to be worth it. If you have access to a laptop or desktop just use iMovie.

No interference, nothing unpleasant. A nice clear sound. Now here’s the problem. I come to record my second video and after hearing the finished product of the second video - it’s COMPLETELY out of time and does not fall in with the initial recording. I have NO IDEA what it is but it definitely is not my headphones because they’re brand new. Keep in mind, there’s a new metronome feature on this app so after making the first recording there’s no need for the metronome because I would be going off the first video. Basically the audio and video don’t match up AT ALLLLLLLL when you put in the recordings together. Maybe if I wasn’t a musician this wouldn’t bother me as much but because the name of the app is ACAPELLA I would assume that there wouldn’t be timing issues with the recordings.

In terms of ease of transferring projects, it’s fairly straightforward and provides a decent platform for doing so.

There are workarounds, but to me this is such a dealbreaker with an expensive app.Ability to edit takes — I know the video element makes this a little tricky, but if I have a slight mistake I should be able to piece in a short audio clip to “voice over” and cross fade between the original take, without affecting the video. Tempo changes during the song — or the ability to temporarily pause the metronome if you are performing songs with pauses or tempo fluctuations Graphical eq — there are eq settings that can be modified, but graphical eq would be much more convenient to work with in an app setting.Desktop/android support — really need this one. I can’t collaborate with friends who don’t use iOS. I’m still getting used to this software, and I’m probably not aware of all the features it has to offer.

Only one, so that was annoying. Meaning I couldn’t put two in and then line them up on my own.  Second, when I tried to record a simple song there was no way to turn off the sound of the first video that was already there, however you could turn off the metronome. This made the sound come out like heart beats when I was done because I couldn’t turn up the metronome and down the video. This leads me to the third problem, which would fix everything if they let you do this. You can’t move one of the videos a little bit forward or backwards to line them up perfectly.

This category of user (which is pretty massive) is unlikely to be able to justify the recurring monthly or annual cost of unlocking more time. Maybe a one-time payment to unlock the 1-minute timeframe could pull these users back in whilst still making the developers their $$$. Aside from that, the app itself is straightforward. It would be nice to be able to turn off the sound of your precious tracks as you record a new one as an option. It would also be nice to find some way to get Bluetooth headphones to work properly.

The community would grow and flourish and bring more people in if this thing was half the cost.

They don’t see the potential they have here to expand on possibilities of being an industry standard for musicians and bands, working out music with producers as well as making goofy collaborations with friends. It’s more of a bare minimum effort to syphon a monthly fee out of folks with minimum effort to be a quality product.   Another con is there is no type of forum or a more detailed webpage for folks to go to and see how to use this to its full potential. To talk about what kind of interfaces work with this thing.  What kind of dongles and adaptors you need if you are going to get serious with nice mics or recording a whole drum set through a mixing board or interface.

It renders and loads forever, crashes when you save things (beyond frustrating), and has a terrible user interface.  Basically, from a functionality level it’s garbage.  An app should at least do basic functions properly (like save and export) and be easy to use (functions and features should be clearly labeled and easy to find, not buried where you have to look for them) . This is not that type of app. An app that edits music should be able to do a few things above and beyond just those basic operations though. Getting collaboration levels right is a pain and you have to shuffle from record to playback to adjust levels between tracks. Anytime you make a change to something or switch tracks playback starts over from the beginning. That’s something that should be able to be done “on the fly”. If this app were to be stellar, it would need to fix all these problems and maybe add some useful functions like automation, import more than one file from an external source, trim clips, loop function, or multitrack editing.

Some interfaces ie “Rode”, it does not allow you to use them as monitors during playback at all.  Next up is the collaboration tool. This is so confusing, as everyone who the song is shared with must remember to hit collaborate when sending back -otherwise it is locked from the original user(s). A much simpler fix would be to have the original user set the song for collaboration and wherever it goes from there, it stays in collaboration format until saved/shared by original creator. Beyond that the app constantly crashes, the metronome disappears, freezes up, etc. all on a fairly new iPhone. 75% of the time is spent troubleshooting.

To the point I can’t even finish singular questions or interactive portions without entire pages crashing and forcing me to redo my progress. Segments that should take me 20 minutes to finish, take me upwards to several hours, and sometimes cannot be finished at all. On top of this, I was instructed to finish these training bits on my own time, when the app makes it very apparent I am intended to complete them on company time. In addition to the existing problems with this app, I also discovered other problems with the app. Specifically, it drains my phone battery, causes my phone battery to overheat, prevents use of headphones at random when not using the app, and has gone on to even cause other apps on my phone to crash upon downloading it. I strongly advise not using this app until it is updated to resolve these severe functional issues, as they can be harmful to your device’s functionality.I am not posting this in hopes that Subway will make an effort to improve the app functionality.
