# Data Science Project

### Simply put
The main idea is to do examin data on mobile applications in categories such as games and more.


### Questions that are kinda too straightforward?:


- Does an app’s rating increase if it has more ratings? 

- Does the size of an application influence the number of downloads?

- Does the price of an application influence the number of downloads? 

- What genre of game has the most downloads? (We need to clean this data, since games have multiple genres) 

- Do apps that support multiple languages yield better ratings? 

- Impact of age rating on rating? 

- Do newer apps yield higher ratings? 

- Are newer apps larger in size, on average?

- Does an app’s rating increase if it has more installations? Does it matter what type of app it is? 

- Visualize app popularity. I predict that 0.1% of the apps probably has 90%+ of the users lol. 

- Do paid apps offer less in-app purchases? (As the customer has already been charged) 

- Compare ratings and genres of games vs. Non-games. Employ a T-test or manwhittneyu test to test for statistical significance. 

- Do apps that are characterized by multiple sub-genres get more downloads? (Something to do with categories when the user searches for them?) 

- Visualize the different genres of apps a publisher publishes — if the developer makes games, do they make other apps? 

- Calculate how old an app is, and see if that influences rating count 


### Compelling: 

- If a developer publishes a successful application (say > x downloads, > y rating), are their subsequent applications also successful? Compare this with their published apps before and after their “viral” application.

- Use ML to predict an app’s rating. Experiment with passing in different parameters to different models. Could approach this sequentially: Does column X influence the rating? Yes/no —> ultimately decide which columns should be kept in the model.
