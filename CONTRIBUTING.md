# Contribution Guideline

- Make sure there is an issue for the feature you are working on in the **Issues** section of github.

- **main** branch is always the most stable branch

- create your branch based on main

```
> git checkout main
> git pull
> git checkout -b <branch-name>
```
- use the naming convention ISSUE-NUMBER-FEATURE-NAME. For example: **07-create-scatter-plot**

- pull the changes to main branch into your feature branch and **resolve conflicts** if necessary

- please add decent description for your pull requests

- contribute on regular basis rather than making a lot of commits over one or two days only.

- once PR is created ask someone to review
